This project is based off of the rti - connector - go `https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector-go/blob/master/LICENSE.md`

All rti artifacts are held in rticonnector-sys/lib and rticonnector-sys/include. These folders are under the rti license.

RTI Connector is not a complete dds implementation but may be just enough for your project.

<!-- RTI is conditionally welcome to add this project and take full ownership of the additional rust code for this project. -->
